  Modal



</h1>





<p>The Modal is a content pane that can go over the user&#39;s current page.
Usually used for making a choice or editing an item. A modal can be opened
similar to how NavController#push works, where it is passed a Page component,
along with optional Page params, and options for presenting the modal.</p>

<div id="open"></div>
<h2>
  <code>open(pageComponent, params, opts)</code>

</h2>

Opens a new modal using the page component is was pass as the first
argument. This is similar to how NavController's `push` method works.
Currently you must have `<ion-overlay>` in the @App component's template
for the modal to work correctly. (This is something that will
be hopefully be removed in the near future.)

      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Optional data which can be passed to the page
component, which can be read from the constructor&#39;s <code>NavParams</code>.</p>

      <td>
        <p>Additional options for this one modal instance of.
Options include <code>enterAnimation</code> and <code>leaveAnimation</code>, which
allows customization of which animation to use.</p>

* Returns: 
  <code>Promise</code> Returns a promise which resolves when the modal has
loaded and its entering animation has completed. The resolved promise's
value is the instance of the newly created modal.




<div id="get"></div>
<h2>
  <code>get(handle)</code>

</h2>

Get the instance of a modal. This is usually helpful to getting ahold of a
certain modal, from anywhere within the app, and closing it. By calling
just `get()` without a `handle` argument, it'll return the active modal
on top (it is possible to have multipe modals opened at the same time).
If getting just the active modal isn't enough, when creating
a modal, it's options can be given a `handle`, which is simply a string-based
name for the modal instance. You can later get a reference to that modal's
instance by calling this method with the same handle name.
