Theme support is baked right in to your Ionic apps. To change the theme, just tweak the `$colors` [map](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#maps) in your `app/theme/app.variables.scss` file:

```scss
$colors: (

  primary:    #387ef5,
  secondary:  #32db64,
  danger:     #f53d3d,
  light:      #f4f4f4,
  dark:       #222,

);

```

The fastest way to change the theme of your Ionic app is to set a new value for `primary`, since Ionic uses the primary color by default for buttons and other components.

## Custom Colors

To add custom colors, just add them to the `$colors` map:

```scss
$colors: (
  // ...
  twitter:    #55acee
)
```

Ionic makes the `$colors` keys available as a property to many components. For example, to use our `twitter` color, add the key as a property:

```html
<button twitter>I'm a button</button>
```
