<h2 id="popups" class="section-header">Popups</h2>
Popups are a great way to require the user to take a specific action. They can provide the user with important information, and require them to make a decision. Ionic provides three types of popups &mdash; **alert**, **confirm**, and **prompt**. Each popup is meant to be used in a different scenario.

The **alert** popup simply displays a message to the user, and provides a button to close the popup. This popup is useful for displaying important messages (eg: *"Your battery is low!"*).

The **confirm** popup displays a message, and gives the user the option to either cancel or confirm their action. This popup is useful when the user wants to perform an uncommon, but important action (eg: *"Are you sure you'd like to delete your account?"*).

The **prompt** popup displays a message, and requires to user to input some data. This popup is useful when you need important information from the user in order to continue (eg: *"Please re-enter your password to continue."*).

Popups are quite flexible, and can easily be customized. Check out the [API docs](../api/components/popup/Popup) for more information.
