Ionic's grid system is based on [flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/), a CSS feature supported by all devices that Ionic supports. The grid is composed of two units &mdash; _rows_ and _columns_. Columns will expand to fill their row, and will resize to fit additional columns.

Use the `offset` attribute on a column to set its percent offset from the left (eg: `offset-25`). To change how columns in a row align vertically, add the `center` or `baseline` attribute to an `<ion-row>`.
