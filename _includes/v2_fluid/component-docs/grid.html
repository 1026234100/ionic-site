Ionic's grid system is based on [flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/), a CSS feature supported by all devices that Ionic supports. The grid is composed of three units &mdash; _grid_, _rows_ and _columns_. Columns will expand to fill their row, and will resize to fit additional columns.

Rows have no padding or margin applied to them. If that is needed, `ion-grid` can be added to provide additional padding.

The width, offset, wrapping behavior, and other aspects of the components in Ionic's grid system can be customized with [utility attributes]('../theming/css-utilities#ion-grid-properties').
