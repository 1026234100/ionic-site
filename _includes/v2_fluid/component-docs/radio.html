<h2 id="radio" class="section-header">Radio</h2>

Like the [checkbox](#checkbox), a radio is an input component that holds a *boolean* value. Under the hood, radios are no different than HTML radio inputs. However, like other Ionic components, radios are styled differently on each platform. Unlike checkboxes, radio components form a group, where only one radio can be selected at a time. Use the `checked` attribute to set the default value, and the `disabled` attribute to disable the user from changing the value:

```html
<ion-radio-group>

  <ion-header>
    Language
  </ion-header>

  <ion-radio checked="true">
    Go
  </ion-radio>

  <ion-radio>
    Rust
  </ion-radio>

</ion-radio-group>
```
