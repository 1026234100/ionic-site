Cards are a great way to display content, and are a core design pattern for apps. Cards make it easy to display the same information visually across many different screen sizes, they allow greater control, are flexible, and can even be animated. Cards are usually stacked on top of one another, but they can also be used like a "page" and swiped between, left and right.

_For complete usage information, check out the [Card API docs](../api/components/card/Card)._

  <ion-card-content>
    Card body content
  </ion-card-content>
</ion-card>
